This script simplifies the WAC (Windows Admin Center) and its prerequisites installation prior to a Vmware to Hyper-V migration: WAC, VDDK, Vmware PowerCLI, C++ etc. 
THe WAC VM conversion nupkg package doesn't get installed since it's still in preview and not available in default feed. Please install it from the WAC interface.
Please let me know of any issues.
I don't take any credit for it since it was mostly AI generated, but one still has to give the right input to the AI, remediate any errors it makes, optimize the script and test run it.
